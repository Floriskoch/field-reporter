###Stakeholder Engagement

Images convey what data and email alone cannot. When people read about your work projects they might miss vital contextual information and a personal connection to the people behind the project at hand.

Visual stories create a full impression of what is happening in any location you are working in, blending reason with emotion and image with information. This creates easy advantages over burdensome administration, reporting and communication.

Knowledge of what makes a great story is embedded in the tool itself. Alongside the tool, we give you a range of storyboards to choose from so you can pick and adapt the one most relevant to your situation. The tool allows you full control of the scripts you send out to your reporters, informed by knowledge of great storytelling and effective communication. 

> Data without context is just information. Data with context is knowledge.  
- Albert Einstein
