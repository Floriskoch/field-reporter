    needs to report on the development
    impact they are creating and showcase it
    to stakeholders. The current reporting
    protocols create a heavy burden on the
    local financing partners. Furthermore,
    the traditional reports are not
    convincing critics and/or NGO’s on
    their added value. This bank uses Field
    Reporter to create visual reports on the
    impact created in a more effective,
    authentic and intuitive way.

    is using Field Reporter to reduce the
    transaction costs, mainly related to
    farm visits, and capture the impact of
    the certification program on the farms
    for internal sharing and learning. In
    2017, they intend to use it to feed
    their clients (consumer facing brands)
    with ‘impact stories from the
    field’.

    with an innovative approach to ecosystem
    restoration has projects across the
    planet. Each project has a team that
    builds partnerships, engages
    communities, develops alternative
    business models and has to convince
    financiers and governments. Each project
    (team) has similar challenges and they
    are all working as hard as they can. So
    far, each project had to reinvent the
    wheel because it was difficult to
    capture key insights and share those
    with the other projects in a fast,
    simple and authentic way. With Field
    Reporter, the horizontal flow of
    insights between the projects not only
    accelerates learning. It also benefits
    the team spirit and proves to be an
    effective tool for effective management
    decisions.
