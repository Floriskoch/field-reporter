Title: Team Engagement

----

Text: 

Global teams need to feel they are one together. Face-to-face connection is still an essential part of how we communicate. The picture we build up of another person and how we relate to them, what emotions they convey is intensely visually oriented. 

At the same time scheduling can be difficult. Visual reports eliminate scheduling struggles whilst capturing a rich picture of what is happening in any part of the planet. With a fully integrated video reporting tool, we help your whole organisation or network tell stories to each other, connecting vital information, with a richness of impression that informs good decision-making. 

You and your colleagues or partners can stop wasting time (spending hours) with long emails and filling out forms. Instead, use the remote scripting functionality to give direction to what you really want your colleagues, suppliers or project managers to capture and let the FR app do the rest.
